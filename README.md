After preparing for frontend interviews/giving several interviews, a set of questions and discussions around React and React performance kept coming up. I decided to give a talk on the same at GeekyAnt's React Native meetup.

I distill and summarize the main ideas here, to help you in your frontend development, and to do better at interviews.
